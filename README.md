# StudySphere – Smart Study Planner & Analytics Tool

## Project Idea

**StudySphere** is a full-stack MERN-based web application designed to help students plan, track, and analyze their study habits effectively.

Unlike a basic task tracker, StudySphere focuses on **study session tracking and performance analytics**, helping users understand how they study and improve productivity over time.

The system allows users to:

* Manage subjects
* Log study sessions
* Track focus levels
* Analyze productivity trends
* View personalized dashboards

This project aims to solve a real problem — lack of structured study tracking and performance insight.
